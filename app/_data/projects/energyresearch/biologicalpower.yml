biological-power: '<p>Biological Power or Biological photovoltaics (BPV) is an energy-generating technology which uses oxygenic 
	photoautotrophic organisms, or fractions thereof, to harvest light energy and produce electrical power.</p>

	<p>Biological photovoltaic devices are a type of biological electrochemical system, or microbial fuel cell, and are sometimes 
	also called photo-microbial fuel cells or “living solar cells”.</p>

	<p>In a biological photovoltaic system, electrons generated by photolysis of water are transferred to an anode.</p>

	<p>A relatively high-potential reaction takes place at the cathode, and the resulting potential difference drives current through 
	an external circuit to do useful work.</p>

	<p>It is hoped that using a living organism (which is capable of self-assembly and self-repair) as the light harvesting material, 
	will make biological photovoltaics a cost-effective alternative to synthetic light-energy-transduction technologies such as 
	silicon-based photovoltaics.</p>'
