Waste-to-energy or energy-from-waste is the process of generating energy in the form of electricity and/or heat from the incineration of waste. WtE is a form of energy recovery. 

Most WtE processes produce electricity and/or heat directly through combustion, or produce a combustible fuel commodity, such as methane, methanol, ethanol or synthetic fuels.
