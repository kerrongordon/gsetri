			<p class="lead col-md-8">The appropriate energy research as you would appreciate must be done on sound principles of science, engineering and technology. In addition to the abundance of natural resources of our region, our people will be able to quickly build capacity in learning techniques of production and efficiency to make better use of these resources. This facility would be fundamental to our science students, to learn first hand about solar energy applications.</p>

			<p class="lead col-md-8">The facility was registered in Grenada on 0ctober 2013 as an institute for Solar research, training and demonstration centre in collaboration with the UNIDO/ GNERI Gansu Natural Energy Research Institute.</p>
